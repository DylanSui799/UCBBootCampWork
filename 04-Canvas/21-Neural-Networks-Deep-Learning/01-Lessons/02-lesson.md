### Overview

This lesson focuses on deep learning, an essential technique for advanced machine learning solutions including medical image analysis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection. The lesson will begin with a lecture from your instructor defining deep learning models. Then, after you understand the fundamentals, you’ll build a deep learning classification model that can adequately predict the class from our moons dummy dataset. Next, we’ll turn our attention to model optimization. After a demonstration from your instructor, you will complete an activity using KerasTuner to create a model that can adequately predict scikit-learn's `make_circles` dataset. In the final activity, you will preprocess a medical dataset and create a deep learning model that can predict whether a patient will be diagnosed with myopia.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.

* Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.

* Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
