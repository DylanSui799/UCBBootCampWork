### Overview

This lesson begins with a recap of what you’ve learned about data analysis and machine learning. Then you’ll work with teams to develop a strategy on how you can solve the great debate question that we asked in our very first class: "Which do Americans prefer: Italian or Mexican food?" This will lead to an activity in which you will work with a group to brainstorm how to create a machine learning model that predicts a Yelp user's average rating of Italian restaurants. The second half of the class will focus on how to use Amazon SageMaker, which is built to streamline the process of training and deploying models. After a brief introduction from your instructor, you will complete a series of activities creating, deploying, and then deleting a notebook instance in Amazon SageMaker.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Evaluate the trade-offs between machine learning models.

* Select and build an appropriate machine learning model for a given dataset and business case.

* Design an appropriate machine learning pipeline.

* Create and deploy a machine learning pipeline.
