### Overview

In this lesson, you’ll be introduced to neural networks, a powerful class of machine learning algorithms that are an essential tool for machine learning engineers. Neural networks are collections of perceptron models, which are related to logistic regressions. The lesson will begin with a warm-up activity in which you will use the logistic regression to build a binary classification model, which is the precursor to neural networks. Then we will turn our attention to the basics of neural networks with a series of lectures and hands-on activities that will introduce you to the perceptron model, the TensorFlow Playground, and Google Colab. The class will conclude with a final activity which will give you hands-on experience building your own neural network.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Compare and contrast traditional machine learning classification and regression models and neural network models.

* Describe the perceptron model and its components.

* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
