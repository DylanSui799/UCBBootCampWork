### Congratulations on completing Module 21!

After all of your learning and practice in this module, you should be able to:

* Compare and contrast traditional machine learning classification and regression models and neural network models.

* Describe the perceptron model and its components.

* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.

* Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.

* Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.

* Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.

* Evaluate the trade-offs between machine learning models.

* Select and build an appropriate machine learning model for a given dataset and business case.

* Design an appropriate machine learning pipeline.

* Create and deploy a machine learning pipeline.

Take a few minutes to reflect on your learning:

* What new topics did you learn in this module?

* How has your understanding changed or evolved?

* What are you wondering about?

* What questions do you have?

You will continue to build your knowledge and skills throughout the boot camp. Reach out to your instructor team with any outstanding questions about the content in this module.
