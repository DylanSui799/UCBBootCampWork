What a fun week! This week, you learned about neural networks, and you started using TensorFlow. These topics are sure to put you on a career path full of innovation.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Neural Networks in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Starting a New Job
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Neural Networks in the Workplace

Many financial services firms are adopting neural networks because they offer an affordable solution for including artificial intelligence in their products. This is just one of many examples of industries taking advantage of what neural networks and machine learning have to offer.

Most companies using neural networks employ one of two champion technologies: TensorFlow or PyTorch.

TensorFlow was developed by Google in 2015, and it is open source. It has quickly grown into the go-to deep learning library. TensorFlow is used at companies like Airbnb, Intel, and Twitter. As you experienced, TensorFlow has a significant learning curve because it diverges from common Python processes. It makes up for this by offering advanced features like the Keras Functional API and Model Subclassing API to create complex topologies.

PyTorch is also open source, and it was deployed to GitHub by Facebook in 2017. It has gained popularity due to its flatter learning curve for Python engineers, dynamic computational graphs, and efficient memory usage.

Historically, TensorFlow has been preferred for production, while PyTorch has been preferred for research. This divide is likely to change as the two products continue to adopt each other’s features. For example, PyTorch now has TorchServe, which is similar to TensorFlow’s TensorFlow Serving. The two tools are becoming quite similar, and both are incredibly popular. You should feel confident in your marketability due to your TensorFlow knowledge, and you should also be able to pick up PyTorch quickly if necessary.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Starting a New Job

Once you land a new job, you’ll want to make a good first impression with your team. Here are our top-five tips for a successful first day.

**1. Reach out one week before your start date.** Set yourself up for success by sending an email to your manager before your start date. In the email, confirm the day, start time, and location; ask any remaining questions; and convey your excitement.

**2. Do a test run.** If you are working in person, consider doing a test drive of your commute. If you are working remotely, test your technology and ensure that your internet connection is strong.

**3. Introduce yourself.** Your first week is the perfect time to introduce yourself to as many people as possible. Consider preparing a two-minute introduction that you can share at meetings throughout the week. Your intro should include your role, your past experiences, your skills, and some fun personal facts.

**4. Schedule one-to-one chats.** Schedule fifteen-minute chats with everyone on your immediate team as well as people that you want to get to know in the company. This will ensure that you have unscheduled time to get to know your peers and ask questions.

**5. Put your phone away.** Even if you see other coworkers using their personal phone, your phone should be off limits for your first day at work. To make a good impression, you need to be professional. Turn your phone on silent, and keep it out of sight.

Remember that they already like you (you got the job!). Let yourself relax, and enjoy your first day in your new role.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions; however, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. In a few words, what is a neural network?
>
>    Answer: This is a tricky question that you may get from a hiring manager who wants to understand how you would define the concept of neural networks to a nontechnical colleague. Try to answer in that context and offer a straightforward response, like one of the following:
>
>    * A neural network is a collection of small functions (called **neurons**) that are organized into layers that eventually narrow to an output layer.
>
>    * A neural network is a machine learning algorithm built to mimic the workflow of the human brain.
>
> 2. What are some applications of neural networks in the data industry?
>
>    Answer: With this question, the hiring manager may try to determine how well you understand particular industry-specific issues and use cases for neural networks. Research each company before an interview, and consider how machine learning (and neural networks) may be beneficial. For example, in the shipping industry, neural networks could be used to optimize routes for trucks. It’s more important to show knowledge of the company and industry you’re applying to than to propose groundbreaking uses for neural networks.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding neural networks, TensorFlow, or deep learning to your application materials.
* Register for a workshop at the [Career Engagement Network events page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/). We have more than 50 workshops designed to meet you where you’re at with your career goals.
