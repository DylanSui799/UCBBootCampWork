In this module, we'll explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. We'll discuss the background and history of computational neurons as well as current implementations of neural networks as they apply to deep learning and the major costs and benefits of different neural networks. We’ll compare these costs to traditional machine learning classification and regression models. Throughout the module, we'll practice implementing neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets including image, natural language, and numerical datasets. We’ll close out the module by learning how to store and retrieve trained models for more robust uses.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will use the features in a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by a nonprofit organization called Alphabet Soup.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
