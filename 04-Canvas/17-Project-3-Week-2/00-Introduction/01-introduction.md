In this module, you’ll continue to work on Project 3 with your team. Class will work a bit differently over these weeks because you’ll spend most of your time working on your projects with your group. 

### Preview This Week's Challenge

This module doesn’t include a Challenge. Instead, you’ll continue to work on your third project: a full-stack data visualization web application that allows users to interactively explore a dataset. 

Refer to Module 16 for project instructions and requirements.
