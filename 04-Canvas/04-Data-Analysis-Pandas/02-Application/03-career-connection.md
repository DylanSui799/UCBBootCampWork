Welcome to another Career Connection! During this past week, you built on your Python skills by learning Pandas, one of the most popular Python libraries for data analysis. In this section, you'll examine more deeply how to use Pandas in the workplace, and we will talk about ways to strategize your job search.

**Today’s Career Connection Agenda**

* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Pandas in the Workplace

As a data analyst, you will probably use Pandas on the job. (Don’t worry, by the end of this course, you will be very familiar with Pandas.) Pandas is one of the most popular Python libraries because it can help you to quickly and easily complete tasks that previously took a lot of time. Some observers attribute the rapid growth of Python to the Pandas library ([Why is Python Growing So Quickly?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/)).

As you’ve already learned, Pandas is a powerful data analysis tool. Data professionals use it for data cleansing, data visualization, statistical analysis, and more. Here are a few examples of how companies are using Pandas:

* Zopa uses Pandas to enhance its peer-to-peer lending services.

* Chime uses Pandas to build the machine learning capabilities of its platform.

* Morgan Stanley uses Pandas to build and maintain its global data assets.

Your new knowledge of Pandas is building you up for success in your next role. It’s an essential skill for all data professionals. Don’t forget to add Pandas to your application materials this week!

### Finding Your Career Fit: Strategizing Your Job Search

![alt = "Research Stage"](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m4/lms/img/Career-Connection-Research.png)

Job searching can be an emotional rollercoaster—lots of ups and downs. We find that job seekers with a solid strategy are more effective, more efficient, and less stressed. Below are five practices that you can add to your job search strategy.

#### Network

Networking is an essential piece of your job search strategy. We are big fans of a job search strategy called LAMP. The LAMP method, which stands for List, Alumni, Motivation, and Priority, guides you through creating a list of companies and contacts that match your interests, goals, and network. Check out this [LAMP method article](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/blog-the-lamp-method/) to learn more.

If you are intimidated by the word “networking,” don’t worry! We will discuss networking strategies and tools in upcoming Career Connections.

#### Let the Jobs Come to You

Here are a few methods for using technology to deliver job opportunities to you.

* Create job alerts on your favorite online job boards, such as Indeed.com or ZipRecruiter.com.
* Many companies and professionals use social media and LinkedIn to post about job openings. Be sure to follow companies that interest you and make connections with professionals in the data field.
* Join professional groups, such as [The Association of Data Scientists](https://www.adasci.org/about-us/). These groups will often have newsletters or forums that include job postings.

Note that these methods are an add-on to your other job search strategies, which should also include networking, and online and offline searches.

#### Take Care of your Mental Health

Like we said, job searching can be emotionally challenging. To incorporate mental health considerations into your job search strategy, take a day off once a week, and celebrate your wins!

#### Meet with Your Career Coach

Your Career Coach can help you develop a job search strategy, research job postings, and more. To connect with your Career Coach, you must submit your resume to the “Develop Your Resume” Milestone, which you can find on the Career Services tab of your course portal.

#### Create a Schedule

Finally, schedule all these practices into a job search plan. Our Career Coaches recommend that you apply to 5–10 jobs per week if your goal is to get hired within six months of completing your boot camp. The following table shows a one-week snapshot of a job search plan.

> **Interview Prep**
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the answers for these questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What is Pandas?
> Answer: Pandas is an open-source library that offers easy-to-use data analysis tools for Python.
>
> 2. What are the two key data structures in Pandas?
> Answer: The two structures are the DataFrame and the Series.
>
> 3. What is a Pandas Series?
> Answer: A Pandas Series is a data container for a sequence of data. It functions like a column in a spreadsheet. Pandas Series can hold data of any type, though the values in a single Pandas Series must all be of the same type.
>
> 4. What is a Pandas DataFrame?
> Answer: A DataFrame is a collection of two or more Series. More importantly, DataFrames allow you to work with rows and columns, or tabular data.
>
> 5. What two Pandas functions allow you to select areas of interest from a larger DataFrame?
> Answer: The two Pandas functions are iloc and loc.
>
> 6. How does the syntax of iloc and loc differ for accessing data?
> Answer: The iloc function uses the index position of rows and columns to access data, while loc uses the labels associated with the rows and columns.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Pandas to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Create and fill out your own LAMP table.
* Create a job search strategy and schedule.
