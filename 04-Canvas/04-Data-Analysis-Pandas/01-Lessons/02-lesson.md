### Overview

Today's lesson takes a deep dive into Pandas and covers some of the library's more complex functions. It begins with an overview of one of the most powerful aspects of Pandas: collecting specific rows and columns of data from a DataFrame using the `loc[]` and `iloc[]` methods. You’ll also get practical experience with using Pandas to clean data. Later in the class, you’ll be introduced to the`.groupby()` method, a time-effective approach for performing analytical computations with Pandas.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Navigate through DataFrames with `loc` and `iloc`.

* Filter and slice Pandas DataFrames.

* Create and access Pandas `groupby` objects.

* Sort DataFrames.
