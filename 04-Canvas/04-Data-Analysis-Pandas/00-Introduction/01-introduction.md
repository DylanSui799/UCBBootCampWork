In this module, you'll be introduced to Anaconda, an open-source distribution software, and one of its products, Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook allows you to create documents that contain live code by using Python. It supports over 40 different programming languages, but for this module, you'll learn the basics of the Pandas library.

Pandas is an open-source library that provides high-performance data analysis tools. Using Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library, you'll read raw data from CSV files, inspect and clean data, merge datasets, perform mathematical calculations, and visualize the data with charts and graphs to tell a story.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you’ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
