![A screenshot shows the start assignment button.](Images/Canvas-Module-0-Start-Assignment.jpg)

### Select Submission Type

There are several submission types available for assignments. Each assignment's instructions typically indicate the type of submission you should use. Because many assignments have multiple components, the most common method is to submit a website URL to a collection of files. For this type of submission, select the Website URL submission type. In a separate tab or browser window, go to Google Drive or GitHub and copy the link to your assignment folder, document, or repository. Make sure the folder/file permissions are updated so your instructor and TA can access your assignment. Paste the link into the Website URL field.

![A screenshot shows where to enter a Website URL.](Images/Canvas-Module-0-Website-URL.jpg)

Available submission types often vary by assignment. (They will be listed at the beginning of the assignment.) You can only select one submission type per assignment. Once you've clicked on the submission type, directions will appear. The following example is for a file upload.
