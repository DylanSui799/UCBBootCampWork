This week will focus on collecting data from websites via web scraping techniques. First, you'll learn about how websites are made by using HTML and CSS. You will build your own simple websites to make sure that you understand how HTML and CSS work together to design the content and style of web pages. Then, you'll use your knowledge of HTML and CSS, alongside the Python package Beautiful Soup, to extract specific information from HTML code. 

Once you have developed your web scraping skills, you'll take them even further by scraping real websites. You'll use the automated browsing package Splinter to extract and store data from multiple pages of the same website. There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started!

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will use the concepts you've learned to scrape data from two websites and store it in Python objects.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
