### Overview

This lesson will introduce you to automated web browsing and scraping by using Splinter. By using Splinter alongside Beautiful Soup, you will be able to automate the scraping process and perform more advanced web scraping projects. Since you'll be scraping real websites, rather than saved HTML, you'll learn about the ethics and legality of web scraping. This will help you make good choices if you decide to pursue your own web scraping projects.

### What You'll Learn

* Use Splinter to perform automated browser actions.

* Automate the web scraping process by using Splinter and Beautiful Soup.
