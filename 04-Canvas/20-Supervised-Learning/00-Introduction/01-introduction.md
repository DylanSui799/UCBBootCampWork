Welcome to Module 20! In this module, you'll classify historical data using supervised learning to predict outcomes on new data.

**Supervised learning** involves connecting a large amount of observable information to those outcomes that we're interested in predicting. By the end of this module, you'll have gained familiarity with supervised learning models for continuous outcomes, like linear regression. You'll also have competency in running and evaluating classification models for logistic regression. Overall, you'll be proficient in using supervised learning approaches to predict categorical conclusions and outcomes.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module's Challenge, you'll create a classification model that focuses on predicting and categorizing credit risk.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
