Before beginning this module, ensure that you have installed scikit-learn.

### Install scikit-learn

The following instructions will check for an existing scikit-learn installation.

* First, run `conda show scikit-learn`. If a version is shown for scikit-learn, then it is already installed and you can safely skip the following step.

* If no version is shown, use the instructions found in the official scikit-learn [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) to install the library.
