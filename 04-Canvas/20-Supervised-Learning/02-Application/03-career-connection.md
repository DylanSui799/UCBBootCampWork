Welcome, and congratulations on completing your module on supervised learning! We’re excited to share some ideas with you on how what you’ve learned this week ties into your future career.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Machine Learning in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Negotiating Salary

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### Machine Learning in the Workplace

Many machine learning engineers build models that analyze past data in order to predict future outcomes. Some examples are online recommendation systems, fraud detection software, and speech recognition technologies. All of these systems analyze data and extract valuable insights with little to no monitoring from humans. If you become a machine learning engineer, you’ll be designing and maintaining code that creates actionable insights from vast amounts of data.

If this type of career interests you, we want to remind you that not all machine learning professions hold the title “machine learning engineer.” In fact, many data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers work with machine learning technologies. This is because machine learning has become extremely widespread in the data industry and companies have different protocols for designating job titles. If you are interested in machine learning, you should expand your job search to roles beyond “machine learning engineer.” Instead, you can focus your job search on the technologies and products that you want to work with.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Negotiating Salary

![alt = ""](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m20/lms/img/coding-career-job-offers.jpg)

For many of us, salary negotiation can be a stressful step in the hiring process. In this section, we’ll go over how to prepare for the conversation and discuss tips that you can use if you decide to negotiate.

#### Step 1: Research

Research the median and average salary range for the roles that you are interested in. Try to factor years of experience and education level into your research. The following helpful websites can help you get started:

* [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/)
* [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/)
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm)

#### Step 2: Determine Your Ideal Salary

Consider your personal finances and the research you did in Step 1. Decide on a salary that you would accept for a position. You may also want to decide on a “walk-away number,” or a salary amount that you are unwilling to consider.

#### Step 3: Negotiate

Now that you have determined your ideal salary, it’s time to negotiate. Use the following recommendations:

* Express your interest in the role. Negotiating salary doesn’t have to be a negative experience. Convey that you are excited about the role and interested in agreeing on an offer that you can accept.

* Let the company go first: Do your best to get the company to pick a number first. You do not want to risk limiting yourself by being the first to pick a number.

* Ask questions to help you get a better understanding of the company’s flexibility. Consider asking “How did your team settle on this number?” or “How do raises or promotions occur at the company?”

Also, remember that you can negotiate terms other than salary. Signing bonuses, PTO, health benefits, cultural perks, professional development, retirement funds, stock options, and equity are other negotiable terms.

As always, we have lots of resources for you! To learn more about salary negotiation, check out the following resources:

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the provided one.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should prepare you to answer them.
>
> **1. What’s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Provide an example or two of each.**
>
>    Answer: The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning involves labels. If you have labels (that is, a y column of data) and want to predict the relationship between several features and these y values, you have a supervised learning problem. Conversely, if you have data only about features and want to group the data into identifiable patterns or chunks based on the similarity of these features, you have an unsupervised learning problem.
>
>    For an example of unsupervised learning, consider various cryptocurrencies. For each cryptocurrency, lots of feature data exists, such as the market capitalization, liquidity (how often it trades in cryptocurrency exchanges), and hash rate. Perhaps you want to understand which cryptocurrencies most resemble each other. This is an unsupervised learning problem, because you want to group the cryptocurrencies into similar categories based on various features of the data.
>
>    Conversely, an example of supervised learning occurs if you have data on cryptocurrency prices, past trading behavior, and cryptocurrency market sentiment. Say that you want to use this data to predict future cryptocurrency returns. In supervised learning, you build a model in which your y variable (what you want to predict) consists of the future cryptocurrency returns and your X data (the features or the data that you use to build those predictions) consists of the past prices, trading behavior, and sentiment. In this setting, you have labels, because you have data about whether the cryptocurrency prices ultimately went up or down and by how much. It’s then up to you to figure out whether those X variables, when put into a model, can reliably predict those movements.
>
> **2. What’s the difference between classification and regression? Provide an example or two of each.**
>
>    Answer: In supervised learning, classification and regression are two types of models for making predictions. You use classification models when you need to predict categories or outcomes. For example, if you want to predict which credit score bucket (say, “excellent,” “great,” or “risky”) a borrower belongs in, you use classification. By contrast, you use regression when you need to predict quantities or continuous values. Regression can prove useful for forecasting returns, risk metrics, or other indicators if the output falls within a numerical range of values.
>
> **3. What is precision and recall?**
>
>    Answer: You use precision and recall in classification-based supervised learning problems. (You don’t use them for regression-based supervised learning problems.) They indicate how well your model predicted a particular category, like “default” or “not default.” The recall is the true positive rate. Of all the true positives in the data (that is, all the 1 values in the y column, for example), how many did your model accurately predict? The precision, also known as the positive predictive value, measures how confident you are that the model correctly made the positive predictions. That is, it compares the number that the model predicted as true to the number that the dataset knows to actually be true.
It’s often hard to remember the difference between precision and recall. But a strong possibility exists that you’ll be asked. For that reason, it is helpful to have a way to visualize the difference.
>
>    Here’s an example: Say that you have a tin of both cinnamon and oatmeal cookies. You want to evaluate the performance of your oatmeal cookie grabbing. That is, of all the oatmeal cookies in the cookie tin, how many did you successfully grab? That’s the recall. If you grabbed every oatmeal cookie, you were an exemplary oatmeal cookie grabber, with 100% recall.
>
>    But the cookie tin has cinnamon cookies too. What if, in your fervor for the oatmeal cookies, you accidentally grabbed a few cinnamon ones? You’d still have perfect recall, because you grabbed all the oatmeal cookies. But you didn’t have complete precision, because you accidentally grabbed a few cinnamon cookies too. So, the precision for your oatmeal cookies is lower, because, of all the cookies that you grabbed and thought were oatmeal, maybe only 8 out of 10 actually were. The recall measures how many oatmeal cookies you grabbed from the ones that existed in the tin. The precision relates to how many cinnamon cookies you accidentally grabbed.
