### Congratulations on Completing Module 20

After all of your learning and practice in this module, you should be able to:

* Model and fit several supervised learning classification models using `scikit-learn`.

* Conceptualize and build training and test datasets for supervised learning analysis.

* Define classification in the context of machine learning.

* Evaluate classification algorithms using a confusion matrix and classification report.

* Explain how the SVM model works as a binary classifier.

* Explain how decision trees and random forest work as classifiers, and how they differ from each other.

* Explain how KNN algorithms work as classifiers and how they differ from other classifiers.

* Apply fundamental classification algorithms, namely SVMs, random forest, decision trees, and KNN in machine learning models.

Take a few minutes to reflect on your learning by considering the following questions:

* What new topics did you learn in this module?

* How has your understanding changed or evolved?

* What are you wondering about?

* What questions do you have?

* How would you define the model evaluation metrics that apply to classification problems? And what are the pros and cons of each?

Youâ€™ll continue to build your knowledge and skills throughout the boot camp. Reach out to your instructional team with any outstanding questions about the content in this module.
