### Overview

In this lesson, you’ll explore supervised learning in-depth. You’ll learn more about classification models like support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and about ensemble learning techniques by using the random forest model.

### What You’ll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

* Explain how SVMs work as a binary classifier.

* Explain how decision trees and random forest work as classifiers, and how they differ from each other.

* Explain how the KNN algorithm works as a classifier and how it differs from other classifiers.

* Apply fundamental classification algorithms, namely SVMs, random forest, decision trees, and KNN in machine learning models.
