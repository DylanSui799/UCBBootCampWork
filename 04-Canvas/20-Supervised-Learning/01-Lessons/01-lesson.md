### Overview

The first lesson will introduce you to linear regression and mainly cover two topics. The first is a supervised learning model for classification for the logistic regression model. The second is evaluating whether a classification model produces adequate results. In the process, you’ll use the `scikit-learn` data science package, specifically to train and evaluate models and make them more efficient and effective at determining the probability of outcomes.

### What You’ll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

* Model and fit several supervised learning classification models using `scikit-learn`.

* Conceptualize and build training and test datasets for supervised learning analysis.

* Define classification in the context of machine learning.

* Evaluate classification algorithms using a confusion matrix and classification report.
