### Overview

Today’s class will begin with an introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNN). The class will begin with an activity in which you will build a deep learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. The rest of the class will be devoted to your group project.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Complete the MNIST CNN example for handwriting recognition.

* Load an image file into a data array.

* Develop predictions by using pre-trained models.

* Make progress on your final project.
