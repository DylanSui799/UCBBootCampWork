### Overview

In today’s class, you will learn how to use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. The lesson will begin with a partner activity to help you build a high-level understanding of CNNs and their application. Then, the class will transition to a discussion of CNNs and their applications. Then, you will use the pre-trained Xception CNN model to predict image labels. Finally, you will use the rest of the class for project work.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Import a pre-trained CNN model.

* Load an image from a file into a data array.

* Apply preprocessing to the input data.

* Use a pre-trained model to make a prediction.

* Make progress on your final project.
