After all of your learning and practice in this module, you should be able to:


* Complete the MNIST CNN example for handwriting recognition.

* Load an image file into a data array.

* Develop predictions by using pre-trained models.

* Import a pre-trained CNN model.

* Load an image from a file into a data array.

* Apply preprocessing to the input data.

* Use a pretrained model to make a prediction.

* Make progress on your final project.

Take a few minutes to reflect on your learning:

* What new topics did you learn in this module?

* How has your understanding changed or evolved?
