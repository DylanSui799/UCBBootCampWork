In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Then, you will learn how to use pre-trained CNNs for image classification. The rest of the class will be devoted to your fourth, and final, group project.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

This module doesn’t include a Challenge. Instead, you’ll begin to work on your fourth and final project: using your machine learning skills to analyze, solve, or visualize a problem of your choice.
