For this module, you have already installed all the tools you need!

### Supplementary: R

R is a programming language used extensively by those in data science, statistics, and academia. If you'd like to learn how to use R, download [this optional content](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m23/supplemental/r-supplemental.md) to get started.

> **Note** Learning R is a worthy goal, but remember that learning R is optional in this module; there is no graded requirement for R. If you choose to try your hand at R, be sure to finish all of the final project requirements for each segment first.
