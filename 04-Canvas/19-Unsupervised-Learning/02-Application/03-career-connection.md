Welcome back to another Career Connection! This week, you explored machine learning and how algorithms are used in data analytics. You also spent time learning the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as how to cluster data by using the K-means algorithm. It was a packed week!

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Machine Learning in the Workplace

* Finding Your Career Fit: Designing a Standout Online Portfolio

* Interview Prep

* Next Steps

### Machine Learning in the Workplace

We love what machine learning has accomplished! In this module, you learned several benefits of machine learning, such as identifying trends, improving customer service, and detecting fraud. However, there are also risks. One such risk is algorithmic bias.

Bias can have significant ethical and legal impact. For example, in 2018, Amazon shut down its recruiting algorithm because it found an unfair bias that favored male resumes. As a result of cases like this, the US Federal Trade Commission has established several [guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai) for AI developers. As a data professional, it is your responsibility to know and follow these guidelines so that your machine learning models create an equitable experience for your users.

So, welcome to the world of machine learning! It’s a place of infinite possibilities and great responsibility. To learn more about eliminating unfair biases in machine learning, check out [IBM’s AI Fairness 360 Toolkit](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/) or Google’s [machine learning diagnostic tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/ai-fairness.html).

### Finding Your Career Fit: Designing a Standout Online Portfolio

![alt = ""](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m19/lms/img/coding-career-application-materials.jpg)

Some companies may request an online portfolio as part of their application process. We celebrate this as an opportunity for you to distinguish yourself from the crowd and show off your skills.

You likely already understand that your portfolio should be organized and well designed, and it should showcase your strengths. We’ve laid out these basic requirements in this [Portfolio Guide](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/portfolio-and-github-web-development/#:~:text=Building%20a%20Competitive%20Portfolio). In this Career Connection, we’ll discuss an element that can make your portfolio stand out.

> **Note** The guidance in this section is targeted at students who are starting their careers and students who are switching industries. If this doesn’t apply to you, then you may already be ahead of the curve for implementing today’s advice.

The number-one portfolio tip that hiring managers tell us is for applicants to include personal and enterprise projects. While your course projects are valuable learning opportunities and certainly demonstrate your advanced skills, employers also need to know what differentiates you from a pool of applicants. We suggest including your course projects in your portfolio and adding one or two noncourse projects that highlight your interests and skills. They should also be relevant to the types of jobs that you are applying to. Use the technology that you want to use on the job, show off your transferable skills, and solve problems that you find interesting.

Here are a few ideas to help you get started:

* Help out a friend’s small business.
* Build something related to one of your hobbies.
* Build something for your current employer.
* Create a project related to a specific job description; for example, if you want to work with machine learning, build a machine learning system.
* Expand on one of your course projects.

We hope that this tip helps you take your portfolio from great to exceptional.

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the provided one.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts from this module and the next two modules (plus your research skills) should prepare you to answer them.
>
> 1. What is the difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning?
>
>    Answer: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for intelligent technologies. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI. ML includes technologies that can learn or improve without explicit human programming. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks.
>
> 2. What is unsupervised learning? What is one advantage of unsupervised learning?
>
>    Answer: Unsupervised learning uses machine learning to analyze unstructured data. It’s useful for finding anomalies in a dataset, which makes it a great technology for cybersecurity.
>
> 3. What is overfitting, and how can you recognize it?
>
>    Answer: Overfitting is a situation in which the model starts to “learn” noise or irrelevant data in the dataset. This can occur when the statistical model fits too closely to the training data. Some signs of overfitting are a low error rate and a high variance.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding your machine learning skills to your application materials.

* Create a brand statement, and add it to the top of your resume and LinkedIn profile.
