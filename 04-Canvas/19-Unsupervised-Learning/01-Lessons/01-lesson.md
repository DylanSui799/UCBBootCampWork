### Overview

This lesson will introduce you to machine learning, especially to one approach that we use in this field called unsupervised learning. Often with unsupervised learning, the goal is to let the machine learning help us figure out what groups, patterns, and structures to use for our data. The machine learning can do all that on its own&mdash;without us telling it what those groups, patterns, and structures are. Instead, it learns from the data that we give it and figures them out by itself. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use an unsupervised learning algorithm named K-means to help cluster our data into groups.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Recognize the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

* Define clustering and how people use it in data analysis.

* Apply the K-means algorithm to identify the clusters in a dataset.

* Determine the optimal number of clusters for a dataset by using the elbow method.
