### Overview

This lesson delves more deeply into machine learning by beginning with a recap of the previous lesson and then delving into normalizing, preprocessing, and segmenting data. The goal of the lesson is to enable you to refine your unsupervised learning algorithms and flexibly apply them to various applications.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Segment data.

* Prepare data for complex algorithms.

* Explain the importance of preprocessing data for unsupervised learning.

* Transform categorical variables into a numerical representation using Pandas.

* Scale data by using the `StandardScaler` module from `scikit-learn`.
