### Overview

With machine learning, accuracy isn’t the only performance metric to consider. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, often suffer from something known as the **curse of dimensionality**&mdash;or too many features than we can make sense of in a single model. However, we can often fix this and improve the efficiency of our clustering by applying a technique called principal component analysis (PCA).

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain what PCA is and how to use it to reduce the dimensionality of data.

* Explain how PCA relates to K-means and other applications in machine learning.

* Use PCA to reduce the number of features in an unsupervised learning setting.
