Welcome to your first module about machine learning! **Machine learning** is a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and statistical models to make decisions or predictions about data. With today's computing power, machine learning is changing the world faster than ever before.

This module focuses on a machine learning concept known as unsupervised learning. With **unsupervised learning**, algorithms use test data to build models that categorize the relationships among data points. For example, when you review an item for purchase on a website, unsupervised learning algorithms might identify related items that people frequently purchase together.

For using unsupervised learning models, you’ll get introduced to a powerful Python package named `scikit-learn`.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will create a machine learning model that groups cryptocurrencies. The purpose will be to assemble investment portfolios that are based on the profitability of those cryptocurrencies.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
