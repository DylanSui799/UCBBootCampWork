This section serves as a tutorial for you to set up the tools that youâ€™ll need for this module: Unsupervised Learning.

> **Important** Before installing new tools, open your terminal, and then make sure that your `dev` environment is activated.

## Installing scikit-learn

* Run `conda list scikit-learn` in your terminal. If the response includes a version number for scikit-learn, then the library is already installed and you can safely skip the following steps.

* If the library is not yet installed, follow the installation instructions at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

## Installing hvPlot

* Run `conda list hvplot` in your terminal. If the response includes a version number for hvplot, then hvplot is already installed and you can safely skip the following steps.

* If the hvPlot library is not yet installed, type and run `conda install -c pyviz hvplot` in your terminal.

* When the installation is complete, type and run `conda list hvplot` to confirm your installation.
