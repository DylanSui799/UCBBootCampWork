Welcome to another weekly delivery of career services content! During the past week, you gained experience with structured query language, or SQL for short. Now let’s talk about SQL in the workplace and how to effectively communicate your career story.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* SQL in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Telling Your Story
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### SQL in the Workplace

There are many popular relational databases out there, and your experience in this course will help you build confidence when you encounter them in the field. Remember that the syntax will always be similar, so if you read a job post that mentions a relational database, definitely go for it if the job seems like a good fit! Here is a list of some of the most popular relational databases and what makes them stand out. You’ve already worked with one of them.

#### Oracle

A [Statista.com report](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1131568/worldwide-popularity-ranking-relational-database-management-systems/) from 2022 lists Oracle as the most popular relational database. Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation and is often used by global enterprises.

#### MYSQL

MySQL is the most common relational database. Most developers consider MySQL to be fast, reliable, and easy to use. Oracle acquired MySQL in 2009.

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is fully free, open source, and very popular, with [40% of developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#:~:text=in%20that%20row.) reporting that they have used it in projects. It supports advanced data types like arrays, hstore, and user-defined types, so it is considered a more advanced database than MySQL.

#### Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)

Microsoft owns MSSQL, and organizations must purchase a license to use it. Microsoft designed MSSQL for enterprise purposes, so it offers a large amount of storage space, has high security, and blocks the database while backing up data.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Telling Your Story

![alt = ""](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m9/lms/img/coding-career-application-materials.jpg)

The most popular interview question is a statement: “Tell me about yourself.” Why? Because employers want to know your story! They want to learn how you define yourself and how you became a skilled and capable individual. So, how will you answer this question? This is where storytelling comes in.

Instead of presenting yourself as a list of skills, you should incorporate storytelling to create a more complete picture of your value as an employee. An effective story will make you more memorable, emphasize your strengths, and help you connect with interviewers.

Here are some of our tips for successful career storytelling.

#### Choose a Starting Point

Your starting point should be the big realization that launched you on your current career path. This could be an experience from childhood, your first success, a life transition, or a notable inspiration such as a mentor or another professional.

For example:

“I attended my first hackathon in 2019 and fell in love with the innovative energy. It’s what led me to complete a data analytics boot camp and eventually host my own local hackathon.”

#### Be the Hero

Interviews are your time to shine. Position yourself as the hero in your story. Your goal is to inspire the interviewer and encourage them to hire you for your unique talent and skills.

#### Prioritize In-Demand Skills

As with using keywords in your resume, make sure to highlight your in-demand skills. Include technical skills _and_ soft skills. For example, if you know that the company is seeking creative problem-solvers, highlight your creative problem-solving skills in your story.

#### Be Consistent Across Application Materials

Your story will make an impression in a recruiter’s mind when the details are consistent across your application materials, including your resume, cover letter, portfolio, LinkedIn, and in the interview itself.

Creating an effective story will take a bit of time, but it’s worth it. A compelling professional story enables you to differentiate yourself from other candidates and present a consistent profile. So, grab a pen, journal, and beverage, and start writing your story!

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What is SQL, and how is it different from NoSQL?
>
>     Answer: SQL databases are held in tables, and they are relational (so they can be related to other tables in the database.) NoSQL databases are usually document based, where key-value pairs are used to store data instead of rows and columns.
>
> 2. What is a primary key?
>
>     Answer: A primary key is either a single field or a combination of fields that uniquely identify a row in the table.
>
> 3. What is a foreign key?
>
>     Answer: A foreign key in one table references the primary key of another table. The relationship between the two can be used to join tables together.
>
> 4. What are the different types of joins?
>
>     Answer:
>
>     * Inner join: Returns rows where the fields used for joining match in both tables.
>     * Right join: Returns all the rows from the right-hand table, even if there isn’t a match in the left-hand table.
>     * Left join: This is the opposite of a right join; that is, it returns all the rows from the left-hand table, even if there isn’t a match in the right-hand table.
>     * Full join: The combination of results from both the left and right tables. It will contain all records from both tables.
>
> 5. What is a relationship, and what are the different types of relationships?
>
>     Answer: Relationships are the associations between two columns in two or more tables. Table A will be associated with Table B in different ways, such as:
>
>     * One-to-one: A direct relationship between two tables. A primary key in Table A will be associated with one foreign key in Table B.
>     * One-to-many: A relationship between two tables where a row from Table A matches multiple rows in Table B.
>     * Many-to-one: The opposite of the one-to-many relationship. A row from Table B can match multiple rows from Table A.
>     * Many-to-many: A relationship between two tables where multiple rows from Table A match multiple rows from Table B.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding SQL to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Create a professional story that you can use to introduce yourself to interviewers and colleagues.
