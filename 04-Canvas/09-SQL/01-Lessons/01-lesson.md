### Overview

This lesson will introduce you to one of the most popular programming languages for working with databases: SQL. SQL programmers are in high demand, so this language is important to learn. The lesson will begin with a brief overview of SQL. Then, you’ll complete a series of exercises that consist of using SQL to create both tables and simple queries.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Run Postgres and pgAdmin.

* Create a SQL database and its tables by using pgAdmin.

* Define SQL data types, primary keys, and unique values.

* Load the data from CSV files into a database and then query the data.

* Explain the four basic functions of persistent storage&mdash;create, read, update, delete (CRUD)&mdash;and apply them to a database.

* Combine the data from multiple tables by using JOIN clauses.
