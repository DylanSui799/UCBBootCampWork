In this module, you'll learn how to do data modeling, engineering, and analysis by using Structured Query Language (SQL). Applying your knowledge of DataFrames and tabular data, you'll create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, troubleshoot common errors, and create queries that use data to answer questions. Databases are used everywhere&mdash;in small and large businesses and even by individuals working on personal projects. And, SQL is one of the most widely used database query languages. Its ability to organize and query data, especially on a large scale, makes SQL knowledge a skill that’s highly sought after in the workforce.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will design SQL database tables to hold data from CSV files, import data from the CSV files into those tables, and then answer questions about the data.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
