Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* GitHub in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Creating an Effective LinkedIn Profile
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### GitHub in the Workplace

In this course, we use GitHub to keep a record of our projects. You may wonder whether you will continue to use GitHub as a professional developer. The answer is definitely yes! All developers use some type of version control system to collaborate, track changes, and back up code.

GitHub is also useful for automating workflows. When you are coding in the workplace, your team will have a standard practice for pushing code to the main branch. For example, most individuals first commit their code to their own GitHub branch. Then, the code goes through a quality assurance process before it is committed to the GitHub main branch.

Of course, GitHub isn’t the only version control system on the market. Other options include Bitbucket, GitLab, and AWS CodeCommit. Most companies invest in premium subscriptions of a version control system to ensure that their code is private and secure.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Creating an Effective LinkedIn Profile

We spoke to a Director at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) who grabbed our attention with one insight. Instead of thinking of LinkedIn as a stack of professional portfolios, we should view it as a career landing page where the SEO is done for you. Let’s examine this idea further.

LinkedIn is a dynamic website that uses algorithms to help employers find you and helps you to find employers. When you build a profile on LinkedIn, you are creating an opportunity to connect with over 810 million people and over 55 million companies. How can you ensure that the algorithm connects you with the correct people and opportunities? Here are a few tips.

* **Create an engaging headline.** When employers and recruiters search for candidates on LinkedIn, your name and headline (current job or role) will be their first introduction to you. Seize this opportunity by creating an engaging headline with keywords. For example, “Data Scientist | Visionary Technologist | Certified Scrum Master.”

* **Use keywords in your profile.** Fill your profile with keywords that are relevant to your job search. For example, if you want a position where you get to be creative, use the word “creative” in your headline or personal summary. When an employer searches for “Creative (insert job title),” they may find you!

* **Expand your network.** LinkedIn search results heavily rely on the searcher’s network. First connections of the searcher will show up higher on the list than people who are not directly connected. Also, friends of the searchers' connections (second connections) will rank higher than those who are not connected. So cast your net widely! Start connecting with friends, family, and professionals.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the provided one.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What is a commit message and why are they important?
>
>     Answer: Commit messages are sent with each commit made to a repository. They are important because they allow other team members to see what code was changed and what was accomplished.
>
> 2. What is a git conflict?
>
>     Answer: A git conflict arises when there are two separate branches that have edits made to the same line in a file, or if a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in another. A user must manually resolve conflicts before the branches can be merged.
>
> 3. How often should you commit changes to a branch?
>
>     Answer: Generally speaking, you should commit your changes whenever you’ve completed work that you don't want to lose. Companies may have more specific requirements.
