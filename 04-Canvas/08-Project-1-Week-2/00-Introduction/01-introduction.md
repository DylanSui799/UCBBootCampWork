This week, as you work to complete your project, your group will also put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions. You will deliver this presentation with a slideshow. The goal is to provide your classmates and instructional staff with an overview of your work, and you may use Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Keynote to build the presentation.

As long as you meet the presentation requirements, you are free to structure the slides any way you wish. However, students often find the following presentation requirements to be useful guidelines. They provide a structure to your presentation and ensure that all project key steps are addressed, that the goal of the project is clearly articulated, and that the results of your analysis are communicated to the audience.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

This module doesn't include a Challenge. Instead, you’ll work with your group to complete your first project.

### Presentation Requirements

This section lists the Project 1 presentation requirements. Each group will prepare a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers the following points.

* An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals:

  * Explain how the project relates to the industry you selected.

* An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes:

  * Describe the source of your data and why you chose it for your project.

  * Describe the collection, exploration, and cleanup process.

* The approach that your group took to achieve the project goals:

  * Include any relevant code or demonstrations of the application or analysis.

  * Discuss any unanticipated insights or problems that arose and how you resolved them.

* The results/conclusions of the application or analysis:

  * Include relevant images or examples to support your work.

  * If the project goal was not achieved, discuss the issues and how you attempted to resolve them.

* Next steps:

  * Briefly discuss potential next steps for the project.

### Presentation Day

It’s crucial that you find time to rehearse before presentation day.

On the day of your presentation, each member of your group is required to submit the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.
