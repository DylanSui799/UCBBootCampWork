In this module, you will use Plotly, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. Libraries like Plotly offer interactivity, which can help your audience better understand your data and draw the same conclusions that you did. Later, you’ll use JavaScript to enhance the interactive features of your visualizations by building out buttons and dropdown menus. You’ll also build on your JavaScript foundation to manipulate, parse, transform, and retrieve data from external sources like .csv files and APIs. Finally, you’ll deploy a polished data visualization to the web, all using the power of JavaScript.
### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
