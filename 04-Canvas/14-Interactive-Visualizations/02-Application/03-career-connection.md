Welcome back! You worked with JavaScript and Plotly this week, and now you can make fun, engaging visuals. Next, let’s discuss how web visualizations could fit into your future workplace.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Web Visualizations in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Using the STAR Interview Strategy
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Web Visualizations in the Workplace

When you present data, it is important to consider the audience. When the audience consists of data professionals, you can use code and rudimentary data visuals to communicate. If you are reporting to an executive or nontechnical team member, you should clean up your visuals so that they are concise and easy to understand. This week, you learned about web visualization. Web visualization becomes especially useful when you are sharing data with a consumer or when you know that the audience will want to engage with the data.

Consumers appreciate interactive web visualizations because they are easy to access and share, and (if well designed) they make it easy for people to manipulate the data to fit their needs. Great examples of interactive web visualizations designed by data professionals include those made by The New York Times, The Federal Reserve, and En-Roads Climate Interactive.

You will be happy to know that Plotly is currently the industry standard visualization package for interactive web visualizations. You will likely use it on the job if web visualizations are a required part of your responsibilities. Definitely add it to your resume if web visualizations interest you!

### Finding Your Career Fit: Using the STAR Interview Strategy

![alt = ""](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/img/coding-career-application-interviews.jpg)

Something we often discuss with boot camp students is the STAR interview strategy. Our conversations with industry professionals, boot camp alumni, and hiring managers continue to confirm that STAR is the best way to structure interview responses for behavioral questions like the following:

* Describe a time when you had to deal with a conflict in the workplace.

* Provide an example of a time that you showed leadership.

* What is one of your greatest professional accomplishments?

So, what is STAR? It’s a framework for building responses to interview questions. It ensures that your responses are easy to follow, they fully address the interviewer’s question, and they highlight your valuable skills. Here’s the STAR framework breakdown:

* **S**ituation: Set the scene for the listener by sharing the context of the situation that you are about to discuss. This could include your role, key stakeholders, or work environment.

* **T**ask: Describe the problem or challenge that you faced. Examples include meeting a deadline, impressing a client, or solving a technical problem.

* **A**ction: Explain how you solved the problem or overcame the challenge. This is your time to shine! Highlight the key skills that you leveraged in the scenario. The interviewer will use your response to get an idea of how you would perform at their company.

* **R**esults: End your story with success by describing your achievements. If possible, use quantitative data to back up your results.

Now that you know the framework, let’s review an example. The following is a sample STAR response to the prompt “Tell me about a time when you made a mistake at work.”

> “Two years ago, I worked as a personal trainer at a local gym. The owners learned that I was good with technology, so I started to manage and edit their website. While making edits, I mistakenly published the wrong address to the website. We had about five clients call in and miss their appointments before I identified the problem. Of course, I immediately corrected the mistake on the website. Before I realized what the problem was, we thought that clients were typing in the wrong address, so I also added a Google Maps plugin to help address the issue. Additionally, I provided anyone impacted by the mistake with a one-month discount. Something that I learned from that experience is how important a quality assurance process is. After this situation, I started requesting reviews whenever I made serious changes to the site.”

From this short response, we have learned a lot about the interviewee’s value. We know that they are recognized by their peers as being good with tech, that they care about their clients, that they learn from their mistakes, and that they are creative problem-solvers. This is a much better response than a simple “Yes, one time I published the wrong address on a website.”

Now, it’s your turn. The best way to learn how to give a STAR response is to prepare and practice. Consider writing a few STAR responses when you prepare for interviews.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare
> your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and
> concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should have prepared you to answer
> them.
>
> **Question:** Tell us about one of your favorite web visualizations, and explain what you like about it.
>
> **Answer:** Answers will vary. Some features that you may discuss are the user experience,
> quality of the data, or uniqueness of the design.
>
> **Question:** What is JSON?
>
> **Answer:** JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data, and it is ubiquitous
> on the web. JSON is primarily used to transport data between servers and web applications.
>
> **Question:** How might you create an object in JavaScript?
>
> **Answer:** You can create an object in JavaScript using an object literal.
>
> ```python
> let car = {
>           make: ‘Toyota’ ,
>           model: ‘Tacoma’ ,
> }
> ```

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Plotly, D3.js, JSON, and web visualization to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Write down and practice STAR responses to common interview questions.
* Have you submitted your resume via the career services tab of the course portal? You must do this to access your Career Coach!
