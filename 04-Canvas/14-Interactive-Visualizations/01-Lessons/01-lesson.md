### Overview

In this lesson, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of JavaScript by creating basic charts with the Plotly library. First, you will learn how to store data using variables, objects, and arrays in JavaScript. Then, after you understand the basic concepts in JavaScript, you’ll create a corresponding chart in Plotly. Next, you’ll learn how to control flow with iterations and conditionals by using JavaScript. You'll also use Plotly to create multiple traces and the data array object that generates our multiple trace charts. Finally, you’ll learn how to use functions in JavaScript and apply that knowledge to an activity where you will use Plotly to create a barchart to visualize data about movie ratings.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Describe JavaScript variables, arrays, data types, and statements.

* Implement basic JavaScript control flow (functions, loops, if/else statements).

* Create functions in JavaScript.

* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.

* Create basic charts, including bar charts and line charts, by using Plotly.

* Use Plotly's layout object to customize the appearance of charts.

* Annotate charts with labels, text, and hover text.
