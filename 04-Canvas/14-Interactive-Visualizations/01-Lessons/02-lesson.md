### Overview

In this lesson, you’ll learn about JavaScript methods that will help you organize and prepare data for charts in Plotly. The class will begin with an introduction to functional programming methods in JavaScript through preprocessing data for a Plotly chart. Once you understand functional programming conceptually, you will complete two activities applying your knowledge of JavaScript to create charts using Plotly. Then the lesson will transition to the `.filter` method. Again, you’ll learn the concept in JavaScript first, then have an opportunity to put your new skills to work by creating a bar chart in Plotly. The lesson will wrap up with an activity in which you will sort, slice, and reverse an array of Greek god search results to build a horizontal bar chart with Plotly.
### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Apply the `map()` method and filter to parse data.

* Create and use arrow functions to simplify code.

* Use the `filter()` and arrow functions to manipulate and filter datasets.

* Use ES6 JavaScript methods.
