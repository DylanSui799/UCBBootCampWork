### Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to add custom interactivity to your web visualizations. First, you’ll be introduced to basic document object model (DOM) selection, manipulation, and events using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), an industry-standard data visualization library written in JavaScript. The lesson will begin with an overview of D3 and D3.json from your instructor. Then, the lesson will turn to D3 Select and append. After a brief overview from your instructor, you will complete an activity using D3 to add a new row of data to a table. Then, after a walkthrough and activity using the `this` keyword, class will finish with a demonstration and activity on how to create dropdown menus by using Plotly.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create charts by using data from API calls.

* Use D3 for basic document object model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.

* Apply the `this` keyword to reference elements within a function.

* Dynamically manipulate the DOM through events.

* Manipulate charts through dropdown events and click events.

* Use `Plotly.restyle()` to create dynamic charts.
