Welcome to another Career Connection! This week, you explored Tableau, an incredibly popular tool in the data visualization world. Let’s talk more about how Tableau will help you in your career.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Tableau in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Creating a Competitive GitHub Profile
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Tableau in the Workplace

As a data professional, you will often present your analyses to people who don’t have a background in data analysis, such as clients, executives, and nontechnical teams within your organization. These nontechnical professionals usually won’t respond well to a screen share of Jupyter Notebook or code file. Instead, you will want to use a tool like Tableau!

Tableau does a great job at bridging the knowledge gap between technical and nontechnical users. Its interface and visualizations are easy to view and understand, so data professionals often use Tableau to present analyses. Additionally, Tableau is great for quickly assembling reports when you want to avoid manually building the visualizations.

It may be surprising, but entire jobs revolve around using Tableau! Search the roles Tableau Developer, Tableau Analyst, and Tableau Administrator in your favorite hiring platform. Also, your Tableau skills will set you up for success with similar platforms like PowerBI and Qlik Sense.

**Pro Tip** Tableau has a public profile feature that you can use to show off your work. If you are passionate about data visualization, consider linking your Tableau profile to your resume or online portfolio. It is also something that you can pull up during an interview to show your work.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Creating a Competitive GitHub Profile

Throughout the course, you have been adding projects to your GitHub account. Did you know that this collection of projects will prove useful when applying to jobs? If you plan on applying to programming roles, many industry professionals will expect to see a GitHub profile linked in your resume and application.

Similar to the resume criteria that we reviewed in an earlier module, the GitHub criteria is differentiated by persona. Click on one of the following links to review the GitHub criteria that describes you best.

* [Career-Starter GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-data-analysis-career-starters/)
* [Career-Switcher GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-data-analysis-career-switchers/)
* [Career-Advancer GitHub Criteria](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/employer-ready-criteria-for-data-analysis-career-advancers/)

We suggest setting aside some time this week to compare your GitHub profile with the criteria in this list. When you feel that your GitHub profile is in good shape, send it to a Career Material Advisor for review. You can do this via the Career Services tab in the course portal.

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions; however, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What is data visualization?
>
>     * Answer: Clearly, this question will require your response to go beyond Tableau. However, if you know the company uses Tableau, this is a perfect opportunity to explain how Tableau and data visualization go together. Our advice is to decide on a definition for data visualization and then describe some projects that exemplify your data visualization skills.
>
> 2. What is your daily work process in Tableau?
>
>     * Answer: Everyone’s work process is slightly different, but questions like these help the interviewer determine whether you have an established workflow. Here is an example of a workflow:
>
>       * Understand the project requirements.
>       * Fetch the required data for the project.
>       * Create a storyboard.
>       * Create visualizations in Tableau.
>       * Present the data to the audience.
>
> 3. How do you think Tableau can help establish strong customer relationships?
>
>     * Answer: Tableau can create visualizations that track customer satisfaction. These visuals can then be used by marketing and product teams.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Tableau to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Edit your GitHub profile so that it meets the employer-backed criteria.
* Submit your GitHub profile for review by a Career Material Advisor via the Career Services tab of the course portal.
