In this module, you will learn all about Tableau, a powerful business intelligence application that allows users to quickly create in-depth visualizations. This class will be light on programming to give you plenty of time to gain hands-on experience working with Tableau. During each class, you’ll complete a series of exercises to expand your knowledge. To begin, you’ll learn the basics of working in Tableau: importing, loading, joining, and splitting data. Later in the week, you’ll practice more advanced skills, including how to create groups, sets, and custom calculations. The lessons will build in complexity, culminating in a mini-project where you will work in pairs or groups of three to explore data and create visualizations in Tableau using at least two of your own data sources.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will use Tableau to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to provide data to city officials looking to publicize and improve the Citi Bike program.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, go to the Challenge page.
