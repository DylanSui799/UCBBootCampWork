### Overview

In today’s lesson, you’ll expand your Tableau knowledge to gain experience in more advanced tasks, including custom calculations, maps, and level-of-detail calculations. To get started, your instructor will begin with an overview of how to create groups and sets in Tableau. Then, you’ll practice these new skills in an activity using movie rental data. Next, you will practice calculations by creating visualizations using a dataset on motor vehicle accidents in New York City. After a short break, you will complete three more activities in the second half of class: One on mapping, a second on creating a dashboard, and in the third and final activity of the class, you’ll practice creating level of detail (LOD) calculations with sample data.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to do the following using Tableau:

* Create groups and sets.

* Create maps and use built-in U.S. Census data.

* Create custom calculations.

* Apply LOD calculations.

* Create dashboards.
