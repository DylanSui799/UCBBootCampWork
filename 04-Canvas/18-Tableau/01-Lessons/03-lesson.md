### Overview

Today’s class will be divided into two sections. In the first half, you will complete two activities to refresh your knowledge of Tableau. In the first activity, you will work with sales from a fictitious company to find insights through visualization. In the second activity, you will explore the safety of the world's airlines. Then, after a short break, you will complete one more solo activity in which you will visualize data on the popularity of baby names and surnames, together with demographics and information on name-surname combinations. For the final activity, you will work in pairs or groups of three to complete a mini-project where you will use your Tableau skills to explore data and create visualizations using at least two of your own data sources. The class will end with each of the groups giving a brief presentation summarizing their visualizations and findings.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to do the following using Tableau:

* Perform exploratory data analysis.

* Clean data before creating visualizations.
