### Overview

In today’s lesson, you’ll be introduced to Tableau and many of its built-in functions. To begin, your instructor will give a brief introduction to Tableau and confirm that everyone has correctly installed Tableau Public. Then, you’ll complete a series of hands-on activities on how to load and explore data, create visualizations, and join and split data in Tableau. After a short break, you will complete two more activities in Tableau: In the first, you will create charts to compare candies to practice your sizing, coloring, and labeling skills. In the final activity, you will practice your storytelling skills by developing a visualization to illustrate the best-paid college major and the impact of attending graduate school on long-term pay.

* Import data from various sources, including CSV files and Excel spreadsheets.
