### Overview

Today’s lesson begins with a high-level overview of hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis, and common statistical tests using the `scipy.stats` model. Then, after a brief overview from your instructor, you will complete a series of activities where you’ll apply statistical tests through functions available in the `scipy.stats` library.

Later in the class, your group will resume work on your group project. Continue to ask for help from your instructor, TAs, and fellow students.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will:

* Make progress toward completing your project, finding and analyzing a dataset of your choice.

* Be able to apply ANOVA to compare the means of three or more groups.
