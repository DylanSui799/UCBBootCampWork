Welcome to your first group project! You’ve reached an important milestone in your journey to becoming a data professional.

Over the next two weeks, you’ll work on Project 1 with a team. Class will work a bit differently over these weeks because you’ll spend most of your time working on your projects with your group. But first, you’ll learn a little bit more about how Git can facilitate collaboration.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

This module doesn't include a Challenge. Instead, you’ll work with your group to complete your first project: finding and analyzing a dataset of your choice!
