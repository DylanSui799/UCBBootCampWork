### Overview

Today, you will be introduced to Pandas plotting, a quick and effective way to create charts from DataFrames. The class will begin with an activity where you will identify and create the most effective visualizations for a variety of datasets. Then, after a brief warm-up, you will learn how Pandas can be used to create intricate plots and data visualizations by using the values stored in DataFrames.

Finally, the class will conclude with a group mini-project. With your group, you will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a plot that visualizes a comparison of travelers to Malaysia from different countries of origin.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create plots by using the `DataFrame.plot()` method.

* Summarize the advantages and disadvantages of creating charts by using the `DataFrame.plot()` method.

* Use Pandas to analyze a complex dataset and chart the corresponding visualizations.
