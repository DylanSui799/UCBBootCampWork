### Overview

Today's lesson combines your knowledge of fundamental statistics with Matplotlib and SciPy.
After a brief review of summary statistics, you will learn how to implement these statistical measures by using Python. Then, once you’re comfortable with basic statistics in Python, you will learn a few new statistical concepts and models that you can use in your projects. These include sample versus population, standard error, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear regression.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, by using Python.

* Plot, characterize, and quantify a normally distributed dataset with Python.

* Qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential outliers in a dataset.

* Differentiate between a sample and a population with respect to a dataset.

* Define and quantify correlation between two factors.

* Calculate and plot a linear regression with Python.
