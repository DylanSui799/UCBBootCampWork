In this module, you'll learn how to graph data by using the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib has a rich set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Series or DataFrame. You will use Matplotlib to create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots. And, you’ll make your charts more informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors.

You'll also be introduced to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Using Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy, you’ll calculate summary statistics.

This module covers a lot of territory: you’ll build a variety of charts, leverage your knowledge of Python arrays and tuples, and apply Pandas methods, functions, and conditional expressions. You will also perform mathematical calculations on Series and DataFrames.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will apply what you've learned about Matplotlib to generate a series of tables and figures needed for a technical report about a pharmaceutical study. You will also be asked to provide a top-level summary of the study results.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
