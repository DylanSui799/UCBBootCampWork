Welcome back to another Career Connection. You built upon your Python skills this past week by learning another popular Python library for data science—Matplotlib. With even more Python in your toolbox, you are well on your way to becoming a Python developer and data visualization expert that can help businesses visualize their data and improve their processes.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Matplotlib in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Researching a Potential Employer
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Matplotlib in the Workplace

[With over 15,000 stars, 1,100 contributors, and 42,000 commits](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), Matplotlib is an incredibly popular and powerful tool. Wherever you end up after the boot camp, it’s likely that you will encounter Matplotlib.

As you now know, Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for making static, dynamic, and interactive data visualizations. You already recognize that these visualizations can present the results of an analysis, but they can also be used as tools for exploration.

In the data analysis field, we call the use of data visualization for exploration “exploratory data analysis" (EDA). During EDA, teams create visuals that help them generate hypotheses and determine next steps. It is an iterative process, which usually involves cleaning data, sorting data, generating visualizations, assessing the results, and then repeating the process. Your new friend, Matplotlib, is a useful tool for creating these exploratory visualizations!

### Finding Your Career Fit: Researching a Potential Employer

![alt = "Research"](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m5/lms/img/Career-Connection-Research.png)

There are two stages in the job search when you need to research a potential employer.

Before you apply
Before you interview

In the first stage, the purpose is to discover if applying for the position is worth your time. You will apply to several jobs each week, so try to limit this phase of research to 10–20 minutes. Ask yourself: Does this company share my values? Do the open positions fit my skills? Remember, the goal is to get a job that you will enjoy.

In the second stage, you should research for the purpose of interview preparation. Learning about the company before an interview will show the interviewer that you are interested in the position. It will also help you predict questions that you may be asked and enable you to give responses that resonate with the employer.

You can use the following template to research companies during both stages. Feel free to copy this template and make your own adjustments.

Not sure where to find this information? Here are just a few resources that you can use:

* Company website
* Company social media
* Company blog
* Online reviews
* Press releases
* Company leader bios
* Company employees that are within your network

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the provided one.
>
> Note: The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> Question: What are Python libraries? Name a few of them.
>
> Answer: Python libraries contain bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. Some popular libraries include Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
>
> Question: How do you plot a histogram with matplotlib?
>
> Answer: fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
> ax1.hist(cars.Horsepower)
> plt.show()
>
> Question: Name a few types of plots that you can make in Matplotlib.
>
> Answer: Histograms, Pie Charts, Line Plots, Tables, Scatter Plots.
>
> One way to prepare for a technical interview is to practice. Here are a some free datasets that you can use to play in Matplotlib.

> * [FBI Crime Data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-1)
> * [CDC Cause Of Death](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)
> * [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/)
> * [Walmart Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data)

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Matplotlib to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Use the company research template provided in this Career Connection to research a few data employers that interest you.
