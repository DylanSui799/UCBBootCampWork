This week, we learned a cutting-edge technology that is rapidly being adopted by companies around the globe—NoSQL databases! Specifically, we learned MongoDB, and there are others out there that you can explore on your own.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* NoSQL in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Tailoring a Resume for a Particular Role
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### NoSQL in the Workplace

"The right tool for the right job" is a useful philosophy in the world of data. Instead of debating on the superiority of JavaScript vs. Python (this list goes on...), you need to learn how to choose the best tool for the project. You can put this into practice when choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases.

Although some may argue that one is better than the other, the fact is that SQL and NoSQL are both heavily used because they are both good at what they do well. SQL databases have great ease-of-use, security, predictability, and stability, but lack some ability to scale. NoSQL databases are easy to scale and more flexible, but lack the standardization and maturity that SQL has.

In this course, you have learned to use both SQL and NoSQL databases. Moving forward in  your career, you should feel equipped to choose the best database for the project at hand.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Tailoring a Resume for a Particular Role

In a job description, an employer tells you exactly what skills and experience they are looking for. Your task is to show the employer that you are a match. One way to do this is to tailor your resume to the job description. 

Tailoring a resume shows your interest and ensures that recruiters can see that you are a good fit for the position. It can also help you stand out to an applicant tracking system (ATS), which often looks for keyword matches between job descriptions and resumes. 

We suggest following the following steps when tailoring your resume: 

1. **Review the job description.** Read the entire job description, and highlight any skills or experiences that you have. 

2. **Align your personal brand statement.** The personal brand statement (also known as a summary statement) is the first item that a recruiter reads on your resume. The skills, experiences, and interests that you describe should include the high-priority qualifications that you highlighted in the job description. 

3. **Move the most relevant qualifications to the top of your resume.** Which section of your resume most clearly highlights your value to the company? Is it your technical skills, experience, or projects? By moving the most relevant section to the top of your resume, you ensure that the recruiter sees it right away. 

4. **Include keywords in descriptions.** Review the descriptions of your projects and experiences. When possible, include keywords from the job description. You may also choose to reorder the information so that relevant points are near the top of a description. 

[Ladders Inc.](https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf) reports that recruiters only spend 7.4 seconds (total!) looking at your resume. By tailoring your resume, you ensure that the recruiter sees your very best qualifications in those 7.4 seconds. 

> **Important** As a reminder, it’s never okay to misrepresent yourself in your application materials in order to meet the qualifications of a job description. Being honest is the best way to ensure that you find a good career match. 

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What do you understand by NoSQL databases? Explain. 
>
>    Answer: NoSQL databases, unlike SQL databases, are non-relational. They are useful for managing unstructured and complex data. (Consider telling a short story about a time that you used a NoSQL database.)
>
> 2. When do you prefer to use a NoSQL database instead of a relational database?
> 
>    Answer: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, have fast queries, are easy for developers to work with, and have flexible data models. For these reasons, NoSQL may be preferable when working with large amounts of unstructured and unrelated data, when you are uncertain of how the database may need to scale, or when you are handling data that comes in at a high velocity.

###  Next Steps

* Consider adding NoSQL to the technical skills section of your application materials.
