Welcome to your second Career Connection! On behalf of the career team, congratulations on making it through the second week of boot camp. In the past two weeks, you've added Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to your skill set!

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Automating Spreadsheets in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Discovering Your Career Goals
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

Let’s get started!

### Automating Spreadsheets in the Workplace

You will create, manipulate, and manage many spreadsheets in your data career, so automating your spreadsheets with macros will often be worth the extra effort. These macros are essentially small programs or functions that make complex tasks quick and easy. Whether you are entering information, making charts, or analyzing data, automation helps you perform tasks quickly.

Although it seems like more work at the start of a project, automating spreadsheets is a necessary skill if you want to conserve time and stand out as a valuable employee. An effective way to approach automation is by assessing the percent of your workload that is tedious and repetitive work and using macros to do these tasks. This allows you to focus on the work that is most interesting and innovative and to work on projects that highlight your skills and interests.

Not surprisingly, people are grateful for coworkers that save them time and can deliver quick reports. Strong automation skills can often open the door to leadership opportunities and promotions!

> **Note** Be sure to record the quantitative results of your automation efforts. Employers want to see how employees can save them time and money. You can highlight your efforts with statements like “Automated _____ process, which resulted in the saving of _______ employee hours and____dollars over _____ period of time.”

### Finding Your Career Fit: Discovering Your Career Goals

The “Finding Your Career Fit” section of each Career Connection will equip you with skills and knowledge for discovering your fit in the world of data. Finding your best role, industry, and company consists of six phases: Research, Network, Application Materials, Interviews, Job Offers, and On the Job.

You’ll start with the Research phase, where you reflect on what you’re seeking in a career and research opportunities. Today, you want to create an overview. Why are you here? What’s your next career move? To improve your answers to these questions, complete the following three steps:

#### Step 1: Become Part of the Data Community

The first and most crucial step is to become part of the data community. This will enhance your ability to direct your career path and enable you to build connections with data professionals. Get started today by:

* Following two or three data-focused companies or organizations on social media.

* Subscribing to a data blog or email distribution list.

* Connecting with two or three data professionals on LinkedIn.

* Subscribing to job alerts for relevant positions on your preferred job site.

#### Step 2: Reflect on Your Motivations and Interests

Second, reflect on your motivations and interests. Understanding these will help ensure that your career pursuits take you in the right direction. Take some time to answer the following questions that will become the foundation for your career search.

* What am I seeking in a career?

* Why is data the right fit for me?

* Which projects and teams do I enjoy working with?

* How canI align my values and interests with my career?

#### Step 3: Explore Careers in Data

The world of data grew exponentially with the development of new technologies for analyzing big data and innovations in the field of machine learning. This led to the creation of several new career paths, such as data analyst, data scientist, data systems developer, and machine learning engineer. You'll need to conduct research to find the job positions that interest you the most. Start your exploration this week by following these steps.

1. Visit [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/) or your favorite employment-oriented website. Search for jobs in the data industry by using descriptions like “data analyst,” “data scientist,” or “business analyst.”

2. After you’ve found a few job postings, read through each post, and then reflect on how it matches your values, interests, and goals from Step 2.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> In the data industry, a technical interview is often part of the hiring process. This section of each Career Connection will provide example interview questions and responses. We’ve included this section as a pull-down feature so that you’ll have a choice for when you want to review this information. You can either practice as you go through the course or skip these sections and come back when you’re preparing for interviews.

>
> 2. Can you make a pivot table using multiple sources of data?
>     * Answer: Yes, but the multiple sources must be within the same workbook.
>
