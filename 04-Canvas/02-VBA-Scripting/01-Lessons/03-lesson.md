### Overview

This lesson will conclude your in-depth exploration of VBA scripting, formatting, and loops. First, you will take a deep dive into formatting spreadsheets with VBA code. Then, during the second half of class, you will work in small groups to create a VBA script that takes an Excel workbook with multiple sheets of U.S. Census data, formats each sheet to improve readability, and then combines all of the data into a single table.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Format spreadsheets with VBA code.

* Loop through a table with VBA code and check for changes in values.
