Well done on another successful week! We looked at several interesting data visualizations, and we even developed a few of our own.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Mapping in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Preparing for Technical Screenings
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Mapping in the Workplace

As we discussed in this course, nearly every industry, no matter how niche, can benefit from data visualizations that use maps. These visualizations effectively add the “where” element to data analyses, whether they are about customer behavior, growth opportunities, or finances. Mapping is a “wow factor” skill that you now have in your toolbox. Let’s highlight a few industries that heavily employ geospatial data visualizations.

#### Health Care

In health care, geospatial data visualizations can track the spread of disease, track the origins of disease, and identify health needs in specific communities.

#### Financial Services

Financial organizations can use geospatial data visualizations to make decisions on investment opportunities, and marketing initiatives.

#### Real Estate

Geospatial data visualizations help organizations make purchase and renting decisions based on community demographics and services.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Preparing for Technical Screenings

If you apply for programming roles, such as data analyst, SQL developer, or machine learning engineer, the hiring process may include technical screenings. In a **technical screening**,  the employer assesses the technical abilities of a candidate.

If you are new to the tech world, the technical screening can be intimidating and likely different from other hiring processes you’ve experienced. So, in this Career Connection, we’ll demystify some aspects of the technical screening. The following section outlines the types of technical screenings along with resources to help you prepare for them.

#### Technical Interview

A technical interview is similar to a typical behavioral interview, except the questions are designed to assess the applicant’s technical skills. For example, you might be asked “How often do you test your code?” or “Tell me about a time when you worked with SQL.”

To prepare, try using the following resources and strategies:

* [Data Interview Prep Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/tools-and-resources/)
* Search “common technical interview questions” on your favorite search engine.
* Schedule a mock interview with your Career Coach.

#### Online Technical Assessment

This type of assessment usually consists of a set of multiple-choice questions and/or coding problems that the applicant completes virtually on their own time. Most companies use platforms that enable applicants to write code directly into the interface.

To prepare, try using the following resources and strategies:

* [Breaking Down the Online Technical Assessment Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/tools-and-resources/) (Highly recommended!)
* Practice on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/), or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

#### Whiteboard Interview

In a whiteboard interview, the interviewer presents a coding problem and asks the applicant to write code to solve the problem in real-time (on a whiteboard or a virtual whiteboard equivalent).

 To prepare, try the following resources and strategies:

* [Hacking the Whiteboard Interview Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/tools-and-resources/)
* Schedule a mock interview with your Career Coach.

#### Take-Home Task

A take-home task is typically a brief coding project that the applicant completes on their own time. Usually, the task is similar to the work that the applicant would be expected to do if they were hired.

 To prepare, try the following strategy:

* Research the job duties for the position. The task is likely to be similar to the actual on-the-job work.

The key to mastering the technical screening is to practice coding. This will increase your confidence, strengthen your problem-solving skills, and expose you to more coding solutions. If you have an online technical assessment or virtual whiteboard interview, we recommend asking the employer which technology will be used so that you can practice under less stressful conditions.

> **Interview Prep**
>
>Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the one provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all these questions; however, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. Describe your favorite mapping project.
>
>     * Answer: Answers will vary. Discuss a project and share the link to it if possible. Explain to the interviewer why you appreciate the project and how you incorporate these features into your own work.
>
> 2. What is GeoJSON data format?
>
>     * Answer: GeoJSON is JSON that uses a standard structure built for representing simple geographical features.
>
> 3. What geographical software are you familiar with? Describe a project that you used this software for.
>
>     * Answer: Discuss Leaflet and one of the projects that you completed in the course. Remember to use the STAR Method that we discussed in an earlier Career Connection. Describe the situation, the task, the action that you took, and the results.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Leaflet, GeoJSON, and mapping to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Register for a workshop on the [Career Engagement Network Events page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/). We recommend “Breaking Down the Online Technical Assessment,” “Data Interview Prep,” or “Hacking the Whiteboard Interview.”
* Prepare for technical screenings by reviewing the problems in the Interview Prep pull-down of each Career Connection.
* Practice coding on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/developers/), or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).
