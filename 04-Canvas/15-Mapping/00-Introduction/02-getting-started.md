You’ve already installed and set up all the tools you’ll need for this module, but here is a list of what you will need:

* **VS Code:** You will use a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.

* **Web browser:** You will use a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. We will use Chrome in our examples.

* **Command-line interface:** You will use the command-line interface to run a local server. If you're a Mac user, this means Terminal. If you're a Windows user, you'll be using Git Bash.

* **GitHub:** As you will deploy your final data visualization on GitHub Pages, you will need your GitHub account.
