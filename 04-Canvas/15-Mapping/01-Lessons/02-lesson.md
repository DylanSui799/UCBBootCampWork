### Overview

In this lesson, we'll continue our discussion of GeoJSON and learn how to extend the functionality of Leaflet with third-party plugins. The class will begin with an activity mapping New York City neighborhoods. Then your instructor will introduce you to Leaflet plugins, which are third party libraries that integrate with Leaflet to provide additional features. To ensure you’re familiar with these new tools, you’ll complete an activity to create a heatmap of crime in San Francisco using the `leaflet.heat` plug in. Next, you’ll complete two additional activities with the guidance of your instructor: First you will rodent clusters in New York City, then you’ll work with a partner to complete a Chroropleth map of Florida’s school districts. The class will end with a group activity where you will create a map on your own and present it to the class.
### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Produce heat maps, marker clusters, and choropleth maps using third-party Leaflet.js plugins.

* Research how to use additional third-party Leaflet.js plugins and JavaScript libraries.

* Differentiate between maps and map elements for visualizing different datasets.

* Create and deploy custom interactive dashboards.
