### Overview

You will further develop your Leaflet skills in this lesson. To get started, your instructor will demonstrate how to use the Python HTTP server. Next, you’ll use the Citi Bike API to create a Leaflet map displaying the locations of Citi Bike stations in New York. After you’ve created your map, you will deploy the Citi Bike project to GitHub Pages. Finally, you’ll be assigned to a group for your next project. Your team will use the remaining class time to brainstorm and draft your Project 3 proposals.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Complete an in-class group project using Leaflet.js.

* Deploy data visualizations to GitHub Pages.

* Draft a project proposal in a team setting.
