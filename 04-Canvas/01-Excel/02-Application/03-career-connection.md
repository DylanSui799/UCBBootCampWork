Welcome to your first Career Connection!

At the end of each module, a Career Connection will review real-world applications of the material that you just learned. It will also provide tips on the best career path for your goals. The career services team has consulted with many employers in your industry to learn what will help you stand out from the crowd. Our goal is to provide the knowledge and skills you'll need to thrive as a new professional.

This first Career Connection covers everything that’s available to you through Career Services. Let’s get started!

### Your Career Services Resources

Career Services provides the following resources to assist you in your career pursuits.

#### CEN Plus

In addition to the Career Connection lessons throughout the bootcamp, we have an entire course, called [CEN Plus](https://bit.ly/CENPlus), which is dedicated to career success. CEN Plus is a self-guided course that covers resume writing, portfolios, professional branding, using LinkedIn, networking, job searching, interviewing, and salary negotiation. It has persona-based resources, so you’ll find unique insights whether you identify as a career starter, a switcher, or an advancer. We’ll also share our industry insights and expertise throughout the course.

#### Career Material Advisors

We'll assign you to a Career Material Advisor (CMA) after you submit your first application material for review (typically, the material is your resume). Your CMA will help you build and refine your application materials so that your skills and projects can shine! You'll usually receive feedback within seven business days, and you can submit materials for feedback as many times as you’d like. You can submit your materials by visiting the Career Services tab in the course portal.

#### Career Coaches

After your resume is approved by a CMA, you'll gain access to your Career Coach. Your Coach is available throughout the course and for 90 days after the program ends, and you can meet with them as many times as you need. They will help you prepare for interviews, develop networking strategies, review application materials, and more.

> **Pro Tip** Career Coach schedules fill up quickly! Once you receive notification that your resume is approved, please schedule time with your Career Coach as soon as possible.

#### Workshops and Events

You'll have access to a variety of workshops and industry events to help you reach your goals and connect with professionals in your industry. We offer sessions for individuals who are advancing in their careers and for those entering a new industry. All sessions are hosted virtually for your convenience and are free! Visit the [2U Career Engagement Network Events webpage](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/) to learn about upcoming events.

#### Career Engagement Network

The Career Engagement Network is your online hub for all things career services. It includes a job board, sample application materials, an events calendar, and other resources. For more information, visit the [2U Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).

### Our Employer-ready Goals

We've had conversations with thousands of employers, so we understand what today’s hiring managers are looking for. Our research has enabled us to develop a standard of job-applicant preparedness that we call becoming employer ready (ER). We want to help you become employer ready and gain your dream position.

#### Employer-ready

Becoming employer ready is a crucial first step on your journey to getting hired. The process includes creating a strong resume and GitHub portfolio. We will work with you on both of these goals throughout this course. Once your resume is approved by a CMA according to our industry-backed standards, your Career Coach will connect with you to discuss and define your career goals and set the path for future success. For more information, visit the [Data section of the 2U Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/tools-and-resources/#:~:text=Cybersecurity-,Data,-Analysis) to explore specific employer-ready criteria.

> **Pro Tip:** Students who are marked as employer ready by their CMA are eligible for referral to our employer partners. Employer partners include Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, and many others. Be sure to let us know which partners you are interested in!

#### Getting Hired

Once you become employer ready, we can work on additional steps to help you achieve your goals. We’ll teach you the importance of networking, strong interviewing, and building your brand and online presence. We have plenty of resources for you to use to become a more competitive job seeker. It is also important to note that success in your job search depends on your target role, your market, and most importantly, YOU. We are here to amplify your efforts, not replace them.

And that’s our quick summary of your career resources. We hope that you are excited about the many services available to you. For more information, visit the [Career Engagement Network](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).

See you next week!
