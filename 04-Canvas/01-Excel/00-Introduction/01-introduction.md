Welcome to the Data Boot Camp!

This module takes a deep dive into Excel, a widely used tool with a broad range of applications, from household budgeting to complex financial analysis. As you learn the intricacies of Excel, you will draw on (and enhance) skills that you may already have, including computer literacy, data literacy, and quantitative reasoning. Many of the advanced Excel features you'll learn in this module, such as formulas, charts, and pivot tables, set the stage for the data visualization languages and tools that you'll encounter later in this course.

Using Excel for data analytics will help you start thinking differently about data. What is data? How does it tell a story? How can it be used to answer specific questions or uncover trends and patterns? Starting today, and throughout the rest of the course, you'll learn how to answer these questions and more.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this moduleâ€™s Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database containing 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
