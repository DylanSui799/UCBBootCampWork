Make sure to complete the following setup steps before beginning your coursework.

### Download Excel

To prepare for your upcoming data work, you first need to make sure that Excel is installed and ready for use.

If you don’t have access to Excel, a [free trial](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) of the latest version of Excel is available from Microsoft. The free trial will give you access to the latest version of Excel for one month. You should not start your free trial until the first day of class to allow for continuous access to Excel during the first unit of the course. You will not be charged as long as you cancel before the free trial period ends.

Before completing your purchase, make sure that you've selected the correct operating system and version. Follow the setup instructions when the download is complete.

> **Important** Use Excel rather than Google Sheets. Although Google Sheets has many of the same capabilities as Excel (they even look the same!), Excel has more processing power and provides users with a more extensive selection of formulas and charts.

### Update Excel

If you already have Excel installed on your computer, open the program to check for updates and make sure that you have all the latest features and capabilities. This will also update the software to address and fix any minor problems that you may experience.

To update Excel, follow the instructions for your operating system (macOS or Windows).

#### macOS

Locate Excel by following these steps:

1. Click the Launchpad icon in your Dock.

2. Scroll through the app icons until you find Microsoft Excel, and then click the icon.

##### Update Excel on macOS

Navigate to the Help menu at the top of the screen, and then select "Check for Updates." You will automatically be directed to an installation window that asks how you would like the updates to be installed.

Select "Automatically Download and Install," and then click the "Check for Updates" button in the bottom-right corner.

The next window shows which update you'll be installing. Make sure that the Excel update is checked, and then click Install.

> **Note:** More than one Microsoft Office product may be available to update. There's no harm in updating everything, but the updates are usually large and can take a while to complete. If you want to quickly get started with Excel, then update only Excel and return to update the other programs when you're ready.

#### Windows

Locate Excel by following these steps:

1. Open the Start menu by clicking the Windows icon in the lower-left corner of your screen or by pressing the Windows key (between CTRL and ALT on the left side of your keyboard).

2. Type "Excel" in the search bar. The Excel desktop app should pop up as a suggestion. Click the icon to open Excel.

    ![A screenshot shows the top search result.](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m1/lms/img/data-1-1-1-search-result-excel.jpg)

If this is your first time opening Excel in a while, you'll likely need to update the program. First, open a blank workbook. To do so, from the main screen of the Excel program, click the "Blank workbook" icon. This will automatically open an empty Excel file, or workbook, and check for updates for you.

If you need to update your software, click the "Check for Updates" button at the top of the window.

When you click the "Check for Updates" button, Excel automatically connects to the internet and searches for the most recent version of the software. Depending on how much time has passed since the last update, multiple updates may need to be installed.

##### Update Excel on Windows

On Windows, Excel automatically checks for updates when you open the program. If there's an update available, you will see a yellow banner along the top of the screen prompting you to install the update. Review the [official documentation](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/update-office-with-microsoft-update-f59d3f9d-bd5d-4d3b-a08e-1dd659cf5282) for the steps needed to update your software.

When your Excel software is ready for use, the "Check for Updates" banner will disappear.

### Set Up Your Folder Structure

The next step in the setup process is creating an organized folder structure that will help you easily locate your projects and files as you work. By staying organized, you can avoid searching for files and potentially losing or duplicating work.

Create a folder on your desktop to hold data and other project files. Choose a name that’s appropriate for the type of work that you'll be saving there, such as “Classwork” or “Analysis Projects.” We'll refer to this folder as the "class folder" from this point on. The class folder will serve as your main folder, a central location for course projects. Within this folder, you'll create subfolders for individual projects.

The following videos review the steps for setting up the main project folder and project subfolders. Review the video for your operating system.
