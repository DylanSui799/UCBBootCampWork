### Overview

Throughout this module, we'll be performing data analysis on 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends. We’ll first need to get more acquainted with Excel. This lesson lays the groundwork with an overview of pivot tables. **Pivot tables** are a powerful Excel tool that condense data into a summary format and deliver information based on our questions.

Then, once we're familiar with a few key filtering and sorting tools, we can filter specific data for a deeper analysis. Finally, the lesson will conclude with an overview of conditional formatting.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of using pivot tables.

* Generate and interpret pivot tables.

* Use VLOOKUPs and HLOOKUPs.

* Implement conditional formatting based on logical rules.
