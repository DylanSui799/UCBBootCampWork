With the help of the Pandas library, you can now perform quantitative analysis and create compelling data visualizations. However, you will need special tools to programmatically obtain and parse real-world data. That’s where APIs come in. An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions that applications use to automate the back-and-forth communication between computers.

This week, you will use APIs to obtain and parse data from sources such as OpenWeatherMap, the U.S. Census, OMDb, and more. You will also have an opportunity to test your skills by plotting DataFrames from the API data by using Matplotlib.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Then, after your visualization is complete, you’ll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
