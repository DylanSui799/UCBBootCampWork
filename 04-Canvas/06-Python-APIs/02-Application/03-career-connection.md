This past week was pretty intense, and the material was challenging! But things are now getting interesting because you know how to use many services to collect data and analyze it. In this Career Connection, we will discuss how you can use APIs in the workplace. We'll also emphasize the importance of networking for your career success.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* APIs in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Networking
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### APIs in the Workplace

As you know, APIs facilitate access to data or services, and you will likely encounter APIs in your data career. But did you know that there are three types of APIs? Let’s take a look at the different types and discuss where you will find them in the data industry.

**Private APIs**
These APIs are created exclusively for internal company purposes, and they are only accessed by company employees. Private APIs are extremely common because they can be developed quickly and don't need to be optimized for external users. Companies use private APIs to manage financial data, sales data, marketing data, HR data, and more.

**Partner APIs**
Similar to private APIs, these can only be accessed by a predefined group of organizations. Partner APIs have become a revenue stream for many companies. By charging a fee for API access, companies can capitalize on work that they are already doing. Both Twitter and Pinterest use this model of development

**Open APIs**
These APIs are publicly available. Open APIs are widely used, and they greatly benefit startups and entrepreneurs by eliminating development costs. Examples include OpenWeather, Skyscanner, and Yahoo Finance.

The use of each type of API is a hot topic in the data industry. The API decisions that companies make today will greatly influence the development of the data industry. In this course, we work with open APIs, but you may find yourself using the other two types in your career.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Networking

Job seekers who use networking strategies get hired more quickly than those that don’t. This means that networking is an essential piece of your job search. Lucky for you, the Career Services team provides several resources to assist with building your network.

* [Networking Guide](https://careernetwork.2u.com/articles/networking-guide/)

* [Outreach Templates and Resources](https://careernetwork.2u.com/resources/outreach-templates-and-resources/) (Definitely check this one out!)

* [One Epic Networking Session Workshop](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/#upcoming)

* [CEN Plus - Networking Module](https://bit.ly/CENPlus)

We know that networking can be uncomfortable. Many people prefer to search for jobs and apply online. However, relying on a single strategy means that you are working harder, not smarter. Talking with professionals, family, and friends is the best way to learn about new job opportunities and get an employee referral that will put you on the top of the resume stack.

One of the easiest ways to build your network is to connect with your Career Coach. Submit your resume via the Career Services tab in the course portal to unlock your Career Coach connection.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Read each question, enter your answer in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your response to the provided one.
>
> **Note:** The lesson activities didn’t explicitly cover all the questions. However, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What information will you need to access an API?
>
>    Answer: A base URL, an API key, API documentation, and an internet connection.
>
> 2. What data formats are most commonly used by APIs to send data?
>
>    Answer: JSON and XML.
>
> 3. How is JSON structured, and which Python data types does JSON most closely resemble?
>
>    Answer: JSON is composed of indexed collections and key/value pairs that closely resemble lists and dictionaries in Python.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding APIs to the technical skills sections of your application materials. (Only add APIs that you have used and that relate to the positions you are applying for.)
* It’s never too early to start networking! Reach out to at least one person in your network to update them on your job search or to learn more about the field of data.
