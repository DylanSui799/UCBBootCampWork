### Overview

Today’s lesson will expand your API querying capabilities by introducing you to a variety of new APIs. The class will begin with a short review activity, where you will traverse a JSON file using your knowledge of Python. Then, after you’ve warmed up, you will work with the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides developers with various meteorological data.

Later in the lesson, you will learn about exception handling, which can be helpful when databases and API requests have missing values. Finally, the lesson will conclude with a few activities to help you build familiarity with API usage and reading complex documentation.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create applications with your knowledge of Python and an API’s documentation.

* Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use `try-except` blocks to handle errors.
