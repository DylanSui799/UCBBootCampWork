Welcome to your second group project! You’ve reached another important milestone in your journey to becoming a data professional. This week you'll learn the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process, which consists of extracting data from datasets, transforming the data, and then loading the transformed data into a database.

Over the next week, you’ll work with a partner to complete Project 2. On the first day, you'll learn to use Python and Pandas methods and functions and to list comprehensions to extract, transform, and clean data. Then, you'll pair with a partner to start working on the ETL mini project. On the second day, you'll learn how to use regular expressions to find patterns and extract data from text and string data, and you’ll work on the ETL mini project. The last day of class will be devoted to project work. 

### Preview This Week's Challenge

This module doesn't include a Challenge. Instead, you’ll work with a partner to complete the ETL mini project.
