* How has your understanding changed or evolved?

* What are you wondering about?

* What questions do you have?

Congratulations on taking a step forward in your professional development. The ETL process is a required and demanding skill for data engineers. Projects are a great opportunity to explore a new topic and answer questions that you are passionate about, as well as to gain experience in team collaboration.
