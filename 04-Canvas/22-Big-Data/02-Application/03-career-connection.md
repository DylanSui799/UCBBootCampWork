Wow—this module was packed with information! You explored big data, Hadoop, Spark, NLP, cloud computing, and Amazon Web Services. In this Career Connection, we’ll discuss cloud services in the workplace as well as strategies for earning a raise or promotion.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Cloud Services in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Earning a Raise or Promotion
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Cloud Services in the Workplace

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1062879/worldwide-cloud-storage-of-corporate-data/), over 60% of all corporate data is stored in the cloud. This means that you are likely to encounter cloud services in your data career, and the chances of this are even higher if you work with big data.

As we discussed in the lesson, Hadoop was the standard technology for big data analysis for many years. Then, the introduction of big data cloud computing technologies, such as Spark, grabbed the attention of data professionals. Today, many organizations use cloud services for big data projects because they are easy to scale.

So if you plan to work with big data, you should also plan to use popular cloud computing services. The most common services used today are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Since you have now worked with AWS, you should feel confident in your ability to learn other cloud computing services if required in your next role.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Earning a Raise or Promotion

At some point in your career, you may need to ask for a raise or a promotion. We’ve decided to bring this up now because preparing for this moment ahead of time will set you up for success. Consider implementing the following recommendations:

* **Keep receipts.** Keep track of your major successes at the company in a personal document. Include quantitative figures such as the number of people managed or the amount of cost saved. These “receipts” can be used to demonstrate your value as an employee.

* **Periodically check salary trends.** Stay up to date on the salary range for positions similar to yours. Understand how people in similar positions are being compensated in your location and at your company.

* **Learn the company fiscal calendar.** At most companies, there are specific times when it is most convenient to raise salaries. This is commonly at the end of the fiscal year when the company is planning the next year’s budget. Other times to consider are during an annual or quarterly employee review. Learn these dates and plan accordingly.

When the time is right, this small bit of work will create a strong foundation for your raise or promotion conversation.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> Answer each of the following questions in a notebook file or text editor, and then compare your responses to those provided.
>
> **Note:** The lessons didn’t explicitly cover all the questions; however, the skills and concepts that you learned (plus your research skills) should have prepared you to answer them.
>
> 1. What are the Vs associated with big data?
>
>    Answer: The Vs of big data are volume, or the size of the data; velocity, how quickly the data comes in; variety, the different forms of data; and veracity, the uncertainty of the data. Note that some people include variability, or how quickly the data changes, and value, the potential for business impact from a particular dataset.
>
> 2. Describe some important features of Hadoop.
>
>    Answer: Answers will vary. Some features that you may describe are scalability, reliability, open source, and distributed processing.
>
> 3. What are some advantages of using cloud services?
>
>    Answer: There are many advantages to cloud services. One is that they are usually less expensive than hosting your own services. They also offer scalability and security well beyond what could reasonably be produced using an on-premises solution in most companies.

### Next Steps

* Consider adding Hadoop, Spark, NLP, cloud computing, or AWS to the technical skills section of your application materials.
* Remember, you have access to your Career Coach for up to three months after graduation. Schedule a meeting to discuss how you would like to work with them after graduation.
