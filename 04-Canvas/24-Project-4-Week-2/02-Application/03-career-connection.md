Congratulations on reaching the final portion of your boot camp! 

Over the past 24 weeks, you’ve participated in an exciting learning journey. This boot camp experience likely had its ups and downs, with both intense learning and “aha” moments when something clicked and you felt great about what you were working on.

The boot camp experience can be exhausting. But don’t stop now, because this is just the beginning! It’s now time to move toward the promotion or new job that you’ve been hoping for.

Before you go, we want to remind you of the career services available to you. Many of them continue to be available after graduation! 

### Career Services Resources
In this section, we’ll go over the career services resources available to you now, up to 90 days after graduation, and beyond.

#### Career Material Review

Career Material Review is available to you up to 90 days after graduation. We highly recommend taking advantage of this service for your resume, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile. Submit your materials via the Career Services tab in the course portal.

#### Career Coach

You can schedule meetings with your Career Coach up to 90 days after graduation. Career Coaches are prepared to help you with all stages of your career journey, including the job search, interview prep, salary negotiation, first days on the job, promotions, and more. 

#### Course Content

You can review all of the Career Connection content for as long as you have access to the course portal. We recommend reviewing the interview prep sections in order to prepare for technical interviews. 

#### Online Events

Online events are available to you for an unlimited amount of time. Online events include recruiting events, workshops, networking opportunities, alumni panels, and more. Some popular workshops for data professionals are the Data Interview Prep workshop, the Breaking Down the Online Technical Assessment workshop, and the Talking Tech workshop. Check out all the [event opportunities here](https://careernetwork.2u.com/events/). 

#### Career Engagement Network

You can visit the [Career Engagement Network (CEN)](https://careernetwork.2u.com/) for an unlimited amount of time. We’ve built the CEN to include resources that will support you on each stage of your career journey. Some resources on the CEN include an active job board, online events, sample application materials tailored to your industry, interview prep toolkits, and industry insight reports.

#### CEN Plus

[CEN Plus](https://bit.ly/CENPlus), your self-guided career course, is available as long as you have access to the course portal. All of the course content is open, which means that you can choose to go through the course content sequentially or skip to modules that make the most sense for where you are in your career search.

The career services team is here to support you throughout your entire career, not just during the boot camp. We hope that you will continue to use the resources available to you post-graduation, and we look forward to hearing stories of your success and positive impact in the data industry!
