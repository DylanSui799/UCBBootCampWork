In this module, you’ll continue to work on Project 4 with your team. Class will work a bit differently over these weeks because you’ll spend most of your time working on your projects with your group. 

### Preview This Week's Challenge

Instead, you’ll continue to work on your fourth and final project: using your machine learning skills to analyze, solve, or visualize a problem of your choice.

Refer to Module 23 for project instructions and requirements.
