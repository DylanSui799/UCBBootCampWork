Welcome back! We hope that you enjoyed digging into the wonderful world of Python. It can be overwhelming at first, but Python is an incredibly important skill that has many uses in the data industry. So let’s talk about how Python will be important for your future.

Here’s the Career Connection agenda for today:

* Python in the Workplace
* Finding Your Career Fit: Exploring Careers In Data
* Interview Prep
* Next Steps

### Python in the Workplace

The data industry always needs technologists who can automate tasks, build applications, perform analyses, and develop data science and machine learning tools. You can do all of that with Python.

The [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) shows that Python was the third-most commonly used language among all respondents (JavaScript and HTML/CSS are the first two). [Anaconda’s State of Data Science 2021](https://www.anaconda.com/state-of-data-science-2021) reports that Python is the most popular language used among data scientists.

Why is the data world so in love with Python? There are three main reasons. One, Python has a beginner-friendly syntax that makes it easy to program quickly. Data analyses and applications can be highly complex, which leads to equally complex algorithms. So, a language with an easy and clever syntax can boost developer's speed and reduce the chance of errors.

Two, Python has an extensive data ecosystem with many tools and libraries that make it easy to upload, store, and manipulate data. And thanks to Python's large community of developers, new tools and libraries are always in development. Plus, this vibrant community is full of knowledgeable data professionals that you can both work with and learn from.

Three, the use case for Python spans across many business sectors and products. Companies like Intel, IBM, and NASA use Python for many tasks and processes. In the data industry, people use Python to automate reports, build predictive models, and create machine learning applications.

The use of Python in the data industry will continue to grow. So, your Python experience in this course is setting you up to thrive in the field of data.

### Finding Your Career Fit: Exploring Careers In Data

Recall that finding your career fit consists of six phases: Research, Network, Application Materials, Interviews, Job Offers, and On the Job. Today, you’ll continue with the Research phase.

You chose a great career path! The field of data spans many roles and industries, which means that you've opened a door of many opportunities. Let’s take a look at some of the options available to you.

Below is a list of common data roles. We recommend reading through the list and researching any that interest you:

* **Big Data Engineer**: Builds and maintains data processing systems for large data sets.
* **Business Analyst**: Utilizes data to develop strategies for growth.
* **Business Intelligence Analyst**: Creates visualizations and analyzes business intelligence needs.
* **Data Analyst**: Collects, cleans, and interprets data.
* **Data Engineer**: Designs and builds data infrastructure.
* **Data Scientist**: Develops tools that process and analyze data.
* **Database Administrator**: Organizes data systems and ensures that they run efficiently.
* **Infrastructure Architect**: Implements computer systems that support organizations.
* **Junior Data Analyst**: Retrieves and interprets data while being mentored by more senior staff.
* **Machine Learning Engineer**: Builds algorithms that can learn and make predictions.
* **SQL Developer**: Builds and queries computer database applications.

One more thing! We recommend that you check out a phenomenal resource that we have created for you on the Career Engagement Network, the [Career Pathways: Data](https://careernetwork.2u.com/career-pathways/data/) page. This resource contains information on certifications, in-demand skills, trends in the market, and job descriptions.

> **Interview Prep**
>
> As you progress through the boot camp, you'll learn to use Python for a wide range of data science topics, but one of the most important skills is solving algorithmic problems. Employers often use sites like HackerRank or CodeSignal to test these skills.
>
> Sign up on one or both of these platforms and explore the kinds of practice that are available.
>
> **Practice:** Try to write pseudocode for the problem below. Copy and paste the unsolved solution along with instructions into your IDE (VSCode), and then write the pseudocode steps to solve it. If you are feeling ambitious, you can use Python to code a solution.
>
> **Hint:** You might have to Google some Python that we haven't learned yet!
>
> ```python
> #  Write a function that takes a string input: 's'
> #  Return the number / count of vowels in the input string.
> #  For the purpose of this assignment, consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'
> #  as vowels
> #  the input string will consist of lowercase letters
>
> def count_the_vowels(s):
> #  your pseudocode here
> ```
>
> **Pseudocode Solution:**
>
> ```python
> def count_the_vowels(s):
> # initialize a counter variable to 0
> # loop through each character in the string
> #  if the char matches one of the vowels in uppercase or lowercase
> # increment counter by one
> # return the counter
> ```
>
> **Python Solution:**
>
> ```python
> def count_the_vowels(s):
>     # initialize a counter variable to 0
>     num_vowels = 0
>     # loop through each character in the string
>     for char in s:
>         #  if the char matches one of the vowels in either upper or lowercase
>     if char in "aeiouAEIOU":
>         # increment counter by one
>         num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
>     # return  the  counter
>     return num_vowels
> ```
