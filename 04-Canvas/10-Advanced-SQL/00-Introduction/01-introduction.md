In this module, you'll receive an introduction to three new tools: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. You’ll use these tools to build on your knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. You'll also write and run Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs by using Python.

### Preview This Week's Challenge

For this module’s Challenge, you will use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. You’ll then design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

We'll review the Challenge assignment in class, so you'll have plenty of time to ask questions. To review the assignment ahead of time, visit the Challenge page.
